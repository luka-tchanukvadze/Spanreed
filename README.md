# Spanreed: A Chat App, but Make It Stormlight Archive âš¡ðŸ“œ

[![Live Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Version-Visit-brightgreen)](https://spanreed.onrender.com/)

Inspired by the world of The Stormlight Archive, where Spanreeds enable long-distance communication, I built a chat app that lets you test a new tech stack and communicate in real-time - just without needing any Stormlight.

## Tech Stack

* **Real-time communication:** [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) (because what's a chat app without instant replies?)
* **Backend:** [Express](https://expressjs.com/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) + [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) (goodbye, MongoDBâ€¦ for now ðŸ‘€)
* **Frontend:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (because strongly typed components + sleek styles = happy dev life)

## Lessons Learned

* âœ… TypeScript catches my mistakes before they catch me.
* âœ… PostgreSQL + Prisma make data handling way cleaner than I expected.
* âœ… Debugging is like deciphering ancient glyphs... but at least I donâ€™t need Stormlight to make it work.

## Why This Project?

Building this project was all about learning, experimenting, and pushing boundaries. Plus, now I can officially say I built a real Spanreed! ðŸ˜†

## Features

* Real-time messaging using Socket.io
* User authentication and management
* Persistent data with PostgreSQL
* Clean and modern frontend with Tailwind CSS
